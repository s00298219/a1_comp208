												<h2>About Me</h2>
												<p>Why did I decide to become a Design and Technology Teacher?</p>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img width="600" height="350" src="images/myprofile.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Growing up, I was surrounded by my family members always creating something.
											My father tinkering with anything, my mother experimenting with new recipes.
											My Nanna's painting and quilting, and my poppa fixing old cars.</p>

											<h3>So, as I got older...</h3>
											<p>Technology was my favourite subject in school. There was something about the movement, creativity and 
												endless possibilities that drew me closer to the building and workshop as I moved up year groups. I 
												would ditch my friends at lunch to sit with the teacher watching my laser-cut lamp shade being 
												developed or sit in the textiles room with my classmates flicking through portfolios.
												â€‹Since year 8, all my electives have been under the technology learning area. My schooling experience 
												would not be what it was without great technology teachers who highlighted the importance of their 
												subjects and really pushed me to break away from my friendship crowd who loved sciences and HSIE, and to 
												take on technology units in the HSC. If I hadn't have listened to them, I would probably have left school 
												early.</p>

											<p> When it was time to select subjects for the preliminary and HSC course, I selected food technology, hospitality, 
												textiles and design, industrial technology metal and visual arts. One of the most gut wrenching moments of my 
												little life was when we got our allocated subjects at the end of year 10, and mine read modern history, geography, 
												ancient history, chemistry and mathematics. The classes I had selected either didn't run or were full and so I was 
												placed in the next possible class. I had no idea what to do, and so of course I turned to the most realistic teachers 
												in the school; TAS.
												
											<p> They were extremely disappointed, but really urged me to move schools and try for a senior school that runs more 
												classes and has more opportunities. I hadn't been "on my own" since day 1 of kindy, with my high school being round 
												the corner from the primary school meaning my peers and I were destined to face year 7 together. I was so nervous about 
												leaving everyone and everything I knew, and without those teachers and my parents pushing me to make the move, I'm not 
												sure where I would be today. I absolutely loved my new school, and loved the ability to have choice in what I was studying. 
												The TAS teachers were so knowledgeable and genuine that it reflected in our willingness to learn and performance in assessments, 
												projects and exams. </p>
											
											<p> I ended up achieving band 6's in textiles, food tech and CAFS and a band 5 in visual arts and English. My textiles project 
												received full marks and was displayed at the powerhouse museum for the SHAPE exhibition which I was extremely proud of, as it 
												definitely took an army to complete. But the important thing was that I was doing something that I loved, and I didn't care 
												if it was all I did for 6 months because I never got bored of it (angry and frustrated maybe, but not bored).  The dreadful thing 
												however was what was waiting for me once school was over. I had no idea what I wanted to study. Careers appointments would lead 
												to more confusion and I wasn't interested in the jobs that were suggested. I thought of working within the fashion industry, but 
												I felt it was too fast-paced and competitive for my personality. Discussing with my food tech teacher, she suggested TAS teaching 
												as there was a major shortage and felt I fit the criteria - hardy, patient and passionate. 
												
												A shortage of industrial technology teachers led me to choose the subject as a major and put my beloved textiles as a minor (I felt I 
												had relatively sufficient knowledge but still want to learn as much as I can). I hope to gain a food technology code as I enter 
												a school and begin teaching. </p>
